# Classification-LFD-HCD
Classification using Harris Corner Detection and Linear Discriminant Function.

Part 1:
Using data obtained through Harris Corner Detection we classify the edges, corners, and flat regions based on estimated distributions of each feature.

Part 2:
Using features obtained through Harris Corner Detection we classify digits using a set of bayes linear discriminant functions.
